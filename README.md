# 🏢 IT Industry Database Management System

### SQL-Based Enterprise Data Management Project (Oracle*Plus)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **IT Industry Database Management System** is a relational database project designed and implemented using **Oracle SQL (Oracle*Plus)**.

This project simulates a real-world IT company environment and manages:

* Employees
* Departments
* Clients
* Projects
* Technology Stack
* Salaries
* Performance Reviews

The database is fully normalized and follows proper relational design principles with primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and business-level SQL queries.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a real-world enterprise-level relational database system that:

* Maintains data integrity using constraints
* Handles relationships between multiple entities
* Supports business intelligence queries
* Demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals

---

## 🏗 Database Architecture

### 🔹 Total Tables: 8

| Table Name   | Purpose                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| DEPARTMENT   | Stores department information                |
| EMPLOYEE     | Stores employee details                      |
| CLIENT       | Stores client company information            |
| PROJECT      | Stores project information                   |
| TECH_STACK   | Stores technologies used                     |
| PROJECT_TECH | Maps projects to technologies (Many-to-Many) |
| SALARY       | Manages payroll records                      |
| PERFORMANCE  | Tracks employee reviews                      |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Implemented

* Relational Database Design
* Primary Key & Foreign Key Constraints
* Self-Referencing Table (Employee → Manager)
* Many-to-Many Relationship
* CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL Constraints
* Date Handling in SQL
* Aggregate Functions
* Subqueries
* GROUP BY & HAVING
* Self Joins

---

## 📊 Business Problems Solved (Sample Queries)

✔ Employees in specific departments
✔ Total company salary expenditure
✔ Highest paid employee
✔ Active projects with client details
✔ Employee performance analysis
✔ Client with maximum projects
✔ Promotion due tracking
✔ Project technology mapping

These queries simulate real business reporting used in IT companies.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Oracle SQL
* Oracle*Plus
* Relational Database Concepts
* ER Modeling

---

## 📈 ER Diagram

The database design includes:

* One-to-Many Relationships (Department → Employee)
* Many-to-Many Relationships (Project ↔ Tech Stack)
* Self Relationship (Employee → Manager)
* Business-level normalized schema

---

## 💼 Real-World Relevance

This project closely resembles systems used in:

* HR Management Systems (HRMS)
* Payroll Management Systems
* Project Management Tools
* Client Relationship Management (CRM)
* Performance Management Systems

The schema design reflects practical enterprise data handling scenarios.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Open Oracle*Plus
2. Run the `CREATE TABLE` scripts
3. Execute `INSERT` statements
4. Run business queries
5. Modify and test additional SQL statements

---

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened:

* SQL query writing skills
* Database schema design
* Data modeling
* Understanding of enterprise workflows
* Analytical thinking using structured data
